        <b>Synopsis</b>After graduating from a top university with an impressive
        extracurricular record in the rugby club, Akira Tendou has nailed every
        step of the way to securing his dream job. On top of that, a beautiful
        and kind co-worker always brightens his day in the office! Life seems to
        be going very well for Akira until he slowly realizes that sleepless
        nights and brutal work are his new reality. <br /><br />
        Due to three years of mind-numbing labor in an exploitative company,
        Akira is unable to recognize the tired, unaccomplished person he has
        become. On track to losing all passion in life like several of his
        overworked colleagues, Akira finds his saving grace in the most
        unexpected way possibleâ€”the breakout of a zombie apocalypse.
        <br /><br />
        With the free time he finally has, Akira decides to complete a bucket
        list of a hundred things he wants to do before he eventually gets turned
        into a zombie. Although he is surrounded by the dead, Akira has never
        felt more alive!
